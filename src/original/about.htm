I collected these directories from malls in the Detroit and Green Bay area. They were scanned into my page. You can download and print them, or simply look at them so you know what stores are in those malls. You can be very generous and send another to me if you want to. If you have one, you can inquire about it by sending who you are and what the directory is of to <A HREF="javascript:alert('This address doesn\'t work anymore.');">MallMap@hotmail.com</A>. I'll consider it, and I'll send you the mailing address.<BR>
